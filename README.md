rapgenius.py
============

Python API/webscraper for rapgenius.com

If any changes to rapgenius break this scraper, let me know and I will attempt to fix it as soon as possible (or send a pull request if you fix it yourself)

## As of 2014-07-11, rapgenius has changed to 'genius' and have blocked BeautifulSoup with a 403

~~It is still possible to use this library if you spoof BeautifulSoup's user-agent. Hopefully the site change and new funding will be accompanied with a public API, and this library can transition to being a wrapper for that.~~

Almost a year later, it's finally happening. I'm starting to work on the sequel here: https://github.com/pconner03/wrapgenius.py
